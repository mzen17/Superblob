# Personal ESN Analysis
## Can we use ESNs as our bias parameter RAGs?
**Emergent semantics** (Santini et al,  The International Federation for Information Processing 1999) are a form of data that occurs when a user looks at a piece of media. What does the user feel? It turns out, these form of semantics is highly dependent on the personna of the end user. 

Rahul et al formalized emergent semantics into a network (IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing 2011). This mini-project aims to evaluate the feasibility of using emergent semantics formalized as a graph to create the parameters of RAG bias.

## Some Analysis
### Can CLIP be used to bias RAG?
- A | CLIP is a generalized framework to contrast images.   

## Notes
imagedata is the original high resolution images. To get workdata, please run fix.sh to move the workdata from surveyapp/src/lib to the root. Please contact me at mzeng5[at]uiowa[dot]edu if you need the high resolution images.
