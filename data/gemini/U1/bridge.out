Based on the two images provided, here is a detailed description and an analysis of the landmark features of the bridge visible in the second image.

**Image 1 Analysis:**
This image captures a tranquil riverside scene from ground level. A paved path curves along the grassy bank, leading towards a distant, tree-lined shore. The water is calm and reflective, mirroring the clear blue sky and lush green foliage. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and creating a serene atmosphere.

**Image 2 Analysis:**
This image provides a view of the same river from an elevated position, looking down its course. A prominent feature is the metal railing of a bridge in the immediate foreground. Beyond the railing, the river flows with gentle ripples under a partly cloudy sky. The banks are heavily wooded with mature trees. In the distance, across the water, a structure resembling a yellow-roofed building or perhaps another bridge can be seen.

**Landmark Features of Bridge (inferred from Image 2):**

Based on the visual evidence from the second image, we can identify several key landmark features of the bridge:

- **Metal Railing:** The most immediate and defining feature is the sturdy, metallic railing that runs along the edge of the bridge. It appears to be constructed from tubular or rectangular metal sections, providing both safety and a modern aesthetic.
- **Elevated Position:** The viewpoint is clearly from an elevated vantage point, indicating this is not a low-level footbridge but likely a vehicular bridge or an overpass.
- **Linear Structure:** The bridge extends horizontally across the river, creating a strong linear element that guides the viewer's eye into the distance.
- **Architectural Style:** While not ornate, the railing suggests a functional, contemporary design. It is not an old stone or cast iron bridge but rather one built with modern materials.
- **Proximity to Riverbanks:** The bridge is situated directly over the river and appears to connect two land masses, with trees and vegetation visible on both sides.
