Based on the provided images, which depict various scenes from downtown Iowa City, including streets, plazas, and modern architecture, I can infer that the user is likely referring to the Seamans Engineering building. The images show a mix of modern and historic architecture typical of a university town. While none of the images directly show Seamans Engineering (which is a prominent building on the University of Iowa campus), several architectural features are consistent with what one might expect from such a structure.

The landmark features I can identify from the context provided by the images are:

- A modern, multi-story building with a glass and steel facade.
- A distinctive, angular design with balconies or terraces.
- The presence of outdoor seating areas and pedestrian plazas adjacent to the building.
- Integration with surrounding urban infrastructure, including sidewalks, streetlights, and landscaping.

These features are consistent with the Seamans Engineering building's known architecture: a contemporary structure that stands out on campus due to its glass curtain walls and geometric form.
