Based on the provided images, which depict various bridges and walkways along a river, and the user's hint that these are related to a railway, it is highly likely that these images show the historic railroad trestles and associated structures of the Iowa Memorial Union (IMU) campus. The IMU is located on the banks of the Des Moines River, and its most prominent landmark feature is its unique "riverfront" architecture, which includes several elevated walkways and bridges that were originally built as part of a railway system.

The images show:
- A nighttime view from an elevated stone terrace overlooking a cityscape (likely the IMU's main terrace or a similar overlook).
- A twilight view of a modern arched bridge over the river (possibly the "Riverwalk Bridge" or another pedestrian bridge near IMU).
- A daytime view of a green-painted pedestrian bridge with modern architecture, leading to campus buildings.
- A view from a metal railing along the riverbank, showing the water and distant trees.
- A cloudy day view from a similar elevated walkway, looking down the river.
- A sunny day view of a modern building (possibly part of the IMU complex) with a sign for "INQUIRER CENTER" visible in the background.
- A wide daytime view of the Des Moines River, with trees and distant structures.

These images collectively depict the IMU's distinctive riverfront environment, characterized by elevated walkways, bridges, and views of the river. The user's reference to "railway" suggests these are not just modern pedestrian bridges but also remnants or adaptations of former railway infrastructure that was repurposed for campus use.
