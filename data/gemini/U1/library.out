Based on the provided images, which depict various urban scenes at different times of day (daytime and nighttime), the user has specifically related details to "tree". The images show trees with bare branches, trees with green leaves, and trees decorated with string lights. While none of the images clearly show a library building, one can infer potential landmark features of a library by observing common architectural and environmental elements found in public buildings like libraries within these urban settings.

Landmark features of a library might include:
- A prominent facade or entrance with large windows for natural light.
- A modern or classical architectural style, often with clean lines and columns.
- Outdoor seating areas for reading or community use.
- Landscaped courtyards or plazas with trees and benches.
- Illuminated signage at night, often featuring the library's name.

These features are consistent with the public spaces shown in the images, which suggest a civic or cultural center that could house a library.
