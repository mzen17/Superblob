Based on the provided images, here is a detailed description of what is seen, followed by an analysis of the landmark features of the bridge visible in the third image.

The three images collectively depict different perspectives and times of day along a river corridor.

- **Image 1:** This photograph captures a tranquil riverside scene during what appears to be late afternoon or early evening. The sun casts long, warm shadows across the grassy bank. A paved path curves along the water's edge, leading towards a distant treeline. The calm water reflects the clear blue sky and the lush green foliage of the trees on the opposite bank. A small white sign is visible on a post near the path.

- **Image 2:** This image shows a modern pedestrian walkway or bridge structure alongside a wide, man-made canal or river channel. The scene is set during twilight, with a soft pink and purple hue in the sky. The walkway is bordered by a metal railing and runs parallel to the water. On the far side of the water, there are more trees and what appears to be an arched structure at the end of a concrete embankment.

- **Image 3:** This is a view from an elevated position, likely a bridge, looking down onto the river. The sky is bright blue with scattered white clouds. The river flows straight ahead, flanked by dense green trees on both banks. A prominent feature in this image is the railing of the bridge from which the photo was taken. In the distance, another bridge can be seen crossing the water.

Based on these observations, particularly focusing on the third image which clearly shows a bridge structure, here are its landmark features:

- **Elevated Walkway:** The most immediate feature is a raised pedestrian walkway or path.
- **Metal Railing:** A continuous metal railing runs along the edge of the walkway for safety.
- **Arched Structure in Distance:** A distinct arched bridge or architectural element is visible across the river in the background, suggesting a significant crossing point.
- **Concrete Embankment:** The far bank features a concrete-lined structure, possibly part of a dam or retaining wall for the waterway.
- **Riverine Environment:** The bridge is situated within a natural landscape dominated by water and trees.
