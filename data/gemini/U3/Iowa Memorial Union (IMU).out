Based on the user's description that the first image appears to be the outside of a sports stadium, and given that Iowa Memorial Union (IMU) is a well-known campus building at the University of Iowa, it is highly likely they are referring to the iconic stadium visible in the first image — Kinnick Stadium. The second image, being dark and urban, does not match IMU's features.

The landmark features of Iowa Memorial Union (IMU) are:

- A large, central clock tower with a distinctive clock face.
- A prominent glass-walled atrium or lobby area.
- The iconic "IMU" letters displayed prominently on the building's facade.
- A series of arched windows and classical architectural details.
- The surrounding plaza and outdoor seating areas.
