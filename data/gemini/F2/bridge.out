Based on the provided images, here is a detailed description and analysis of the landmark features of the bridge, considering the user's reference to "Bridge-shot composition" and that both depict a river.

The images show different perspectives of what appears to be the same modern pedestrian or light vehicular bridge spanning a wide, calm river. The first image captures it at twilight or night, with artificial lighting illuminating its structure and casting reflections on the water. The second image shows the same bridge during daylight hours, revealing its full architectural form against a clear sky. The third image presents a view from a different vantage point along the riverbank, showing the bridge's approach and its integration into the surrounding landscape.

Landmark features of this bridge can be identified by observing its distinct design elements across all three images:

- **Architectural Form**: The most prominent feature is its series of graceful, sweeping arches. These are not traditional truss or beam bridges but rather elegant, modern curves that rise above the water. The arches are slender and appear to be made of steel or a similar material.
- **Structural Support**: The bridge is supported by robust, vertical piers that extend from the riverbed. These piers are visible in all images and provide a strong foundation for the arched superstructure.
- **Deck and Railings**: The bridge has a wide, flat deck suitable for pedestrian or light vehicle traffic. It is lined with modern railings that appear to be made of metal mesh or solid panels, contributing to its contemporary aesthetic.
- **Reflections**: A key visual element across all images is the clear reflection of the bridge's arches and lights (in the first image) on the calm surface of the river, emphasizing its symmetry and form.
- **Integration with Environment**: The bridge is designed to blend with its surroundings. In the daylight images, it appears as a clean, minimalist structure that complements the natural landscape of trees and water.

These features collectively define a modern architectural landmark that is both functional and visually striking.
