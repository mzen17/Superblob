Based on the provided images, which depict scenes from Iowa City's downtown area, and the user's reference to "Same side on the opposite side of campus," it is highly likely these images show locations near or within the University of Iowa campus. The Iowa Memorial Union (IMU) is a central and iconic landmark on this campus.

The images show:
- A lively, outdoor patio area with white tables and chairs, suggesting a café or restaurant. This is characteristic of the IMU's famous "Patio" or "Patio Plaza," which is an open-air space for students to gather.
- A modern, multi-story building with glass and steel architecture. This could be the IMU's main building (the "Memorial Union Building") or a nearby academic or residential structure on campus.
- A street scene with a prominent sign that reads "DOWNTOWN IOWA CITY" and another sign for "IOWA." This confirms the location is within Iowa City, specifically downtown, which is adjacent to the University of Iowa campus.

Given this context and the user's hint about being on the "opposite side of campus," these images likely show areas near or connected to the IMU. The landmark features of the IMU itself are:

- The iconic "Patio" or "Patio Plaza" – an open-air courtyard with tables, chairs, and often a stage for events.
- The main Memorial Union Building – a large, modern structure with glass facades and multiple levels.
- The distinctive yellow awnings or architectural accents that are part of the IMU's design.
- The surrounding streets and pedestrian areas that connect to the campus.
