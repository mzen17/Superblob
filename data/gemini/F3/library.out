Based on the two images provided, here is a detailed description and an analysis of what appears to be a library or university campus at night.

**Image 1 Analysis:**
This image captures a street-level view at night, likely outside a large institutional building.
- **Setting:** A paved road with yellow lane markings and directional arrows. The scene is illuminated by streetlights, which cast long shadows and create bright spots on the asphalt.
- **Architecture:** A prominent multi-story brick building dominates the right side of the frame. It features classical architectural elements such as columns, large windows (some of which are lit from within), and a decorative cornice. The facade suggests a formal, established institution.
- **Activity & Environment:** Several cars are parked along the curb, including two red sedans. A few pedestrians can be seen near the building's entrance. The foreground includes a grassy median and sidewalk.
- **Inferred Context:** The combination of the grand architecture, institutional feel, and nighttime setting strongly suggests this is a university or college campus (possibly a library or administrative building) rather than a commercial or residential area.

**Image 2 Analysis:**
This image shows an outdoor plaza or courtyard at night.
- **Setting:** A wet, reflective paved area that appears to be a courtyard, atrium, or plaza. The wetness suggests it has recently rained. The ground reflects the ambient light from nearby buildings and a single streetlamp.
- **Architecture & Environment:** In the background are modern-style buildings with large glass windows and clean lines. One building has a curved facade. There are benches, railings, and some sparse vegetation (a small tree). A round table and chairs are visible in the foreground.
- **Atmosphere:** The scene is very dark, creating a quiet, contemplative mood. The reflections on the wet ground add depth and a sense of stillness.

While "imu" is not clearly defined in this context (it could be an abbreviation or a typo), the images collectively depict what appears to be a university campus at night. The first image shows a traditional, imposing library or academic building. The second image shows a modern, open-air plaza or courtyard area within the same campus.
