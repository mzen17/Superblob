Based on the two images provided, both depict a river viewed from a bridge. The first image shows a wide, calm river under an overcast sky, with a gravel or stone embankment and parked cars visible on the far side. The second image shows a similar perspective of a river, but under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds; the far bank is lined with lush green trees.

The user has related these details to "River with railing," which is accurate as both images show a river viewed from behind a railing that is part of the bridge structure. The landmark features of the bridge can be inferred from these images.

- The railing is made of metal mesh or wire, forming a grid pattern.
- The railing appears to be modern in design, with flat, rectangular metal caps at intervals.
- The perspective suggests the viewer is on an elevated walkway or pedestrian bridge.
- The bridge spans a wide river and connects to a developed area with parking and roads visible in the first image.
