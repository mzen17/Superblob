Based on the provided images, which appear to depict various campus or institutional buildings (including what is likely a library), here is a detailed description and an analysis of the landmark features typically associated with such a building.

**Image Analysis:**

*   **Image 1 (Night Scene):** This image shows a wide street at night. On the right is a large, multi-story brick building with numerous windows, some of which are lit. The architecture is classical or institutional, with columns and decorative elements. Cars are parked along the street, and there are traffic signals and poles. The overall impression is that of a university or college campus building at night.
*   **Image 2 (Dusk Scene):** This image captures a street scene during twilight. A row of trees lines the sidewalk, which is adjacent to a paved area with several parked cars. On the right, there is a modern brick building with large windows and yellow doors. A series of black bike racks are visible along the sidewalk. The sky has a soft pink and orange hue from the setting sun.
*   **Image 3 (Night Scene - Courtyard):** This image shows an outdoor courtyard or plaza at night. The ground is wet, reflecting the lights from nearby buildings. In the foreground, there is a small table and chairs. In the background, modern buildings with illuminated windows are visible. The architecture here is more contemporary than in the first image.
