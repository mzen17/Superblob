Based on the provided images, here is a detailed description of what is visible, followed by an analysis of the landmark features of bridges as inferred from these scenes.

**Image Analysis:**

*   **Image 1:** This image shows a modern pedestrian bridge with light green railings. It spans a wide, paved walkway that leads toward a cluster of buildings. On the left is a contemporary structure with a distinctive blue-tiled roof and stone facade. On the right are older, more classical-style brick buildings with arched windows. The sky is bright blue with scattered white clouds, suggesting a clear day.
*   **Image 2:** This image captures a view from a bridge or walkway overlooking a wide, calm river or canal. The water reflects the overcast, gray sky. The far bank is lined with trees showing autumn colors and a paved road with parked cars. The railing in the foreground is made of metal mesh.
*   **Image 3:** This image shows a view from a bridge looking across a wide, flowing river under a partly cloudy blue sky. The riverbanks are heavily wooded with lush green trees. In the distance, another bridge can be seen spanning the water.

**Inference on Landmark Features of Bridges:**

By examining these images, we can identify several key landmark features that define bridges as architectural and engineering structures:

*   **Structural Form:** Bridges are defined by their physical structure, which includes railings for safety and a solid deck or walkway for passage.
*   **Architectural Style:** Bridges can be designed in various architectural styles. The first image shows a modern, minimalist design with clean lines and specific color choices (light green). The third image suggests a more traditional or functional style.
*   **Materials Used:** Different materials are visible, such as the metal mesh railing in the second image and the painted metal railings in the first. Stone and brick are also prominent in surrounding structures.
*   **Functionality:** Bridges serve a clear purpose: to connect two points separated by a physical barrier like a river or road. The images show them facilitating pedestrian movement.
*   **Contextual Setting:** Bridges are landmarks because they are situated within specific environments, such as urban landscapes (Image 1), natural river settings (Image 3), or alongside roads and canals (Image 2).
