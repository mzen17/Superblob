Based on the provided images and the user's reference to the Iowa Memorial Union (IMU), here is a detailed analysis of what is visible and what landmark features can be inferred.

The first image shows a pedestrian bridge with light green railings, leading towards a modern building complex. The architecture includes a mix of materials: stone, glass, and metal. A prominent feature is the large, angular facade with a blue-tinted glass section and an adjacent wall covered in what appears to be black-and-white photographic or abstract imagery. This structure is clearly part of the IMU's modern expansion.

The second image depicts a street scene at night. A large, multi-story brick building with classical architectural details (like columns and arched windows) dominates the right side of the frame. This is likely a historic building on campus, possibly adjacent to or part of the IMU complex. The street is lined with parked cars, including several red vehicles.

The third image captures a street view during twilight. A row of trees lines the sidewalk, and several bicycles are parked in designated racks. In the background, a portion of a brick building is visible. The overall scene suggests a campus environment with pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

Synthesizing these observations with the user's reference to IMU, it is evident that the images showcase different architectural elements of the Iowa Memorial Union complex. The first image highlights the modern addition, while the second and third images show surrounding historic buildings and campus streets. The landmark features are therefore a combination of modern architecture (the glass-and-stone structure) and historic brick buildings.
