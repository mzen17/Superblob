Based on the provided images, which show various views of a river and its crossings, the user has related these details to "Fence." While fences are visible in some images (like the metal mesh railing in image 2 and 3), they are not the primary subject. The most prominent landmark features of the bridges shown are their architectural design and structural elements.

Here is a detailed description of what is seen, followed by a list of landmark features specific to the bridges:

- **Image 1 (Night Scene):** This image captures a modern, arched pedestrian or light vehicle bridge spanning a river at twilight. The bridge has a distinctive, sweeping curve with multiple arches. It is illuminated by streetlights and reflects beautifully in the calm water below. On the far bank, there are buildings and trees silhouetted against the darkening sky.

- **Image 2 (Dawn/Dusk Scene):** This image shows a different bridge from a riverside walkway. The bridge has a more minimalist, modern design with clean lines and appears to be made of concrete or steel. It is viewed from an elevated path that runs alongside the water, with a metal mesh fence in the foreground.

- **Image 3 (Overcast Day):** This image shows a wide river with a low-profile, possibly concrete or stone bridge visible in the distance. The bridge is less architecturally prominent than others and appears to be more functional. The foreground features a metal mesh railing, similar to image 2.

- **Image 4 (Sunny Day):** This image shows a wide river with a classic truss or beam-style bridge visible in the distance under a partly cloudy sky. The bridge is flanked by lush green trees on both banks.

Based on these descriptions, the landmark features of the bridges are:

- **Architectural Style:** Modern arched design (Image 1), minimalist clean lines (Image 2), low-profile functional structure (Image 3), classic truss/beam style (Image 4).
- **Structural Form:** Curved arches, elevated walkways, concrete or steel construction.
- **Setting Context:** Bridges are shown spanning a river in various lighting conditions (night, dawn/dusk, overcast day, sunny day) and surrounded by natural landscapes and urban elements.
