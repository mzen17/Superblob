Based on the provided images, which depict various urban scenes from what appears to be a single city (likely Ottawa, given the "City View" reference and architectural style), here are the specific landmark features visible:

- A vibrant, tree-lined pedestrian plaza with outdoor dining tables and chairs, situated in front of a row of historic brick buildings. A white pickup truck is parked nearby.
- A modern public square at dusk or night, illuminated by strings of festive lights on trees and street lamps. The scene includes concrete benches and a large mural on the side of a building.
- A street view at twilight, showing storefronts including one for "Barnabas Restaurant Pizza" with its sign lit up. In the distance, a tall, modern glass-and-steel high-rise building stands out against the evening sky.
- A wide sidewalk adjacent to a large, contemporary mixed-use building with a distinctive grey facade and balconies. Colorful benches are placed along the walkway.

These elements collectively point to key urban characteristics of the city: historic architecture alongside modern high-rises, pedestrian-friendly public spaces with dining and seating areas, artistic murals, and well-lit streetscapes that blend commerce with community life.
