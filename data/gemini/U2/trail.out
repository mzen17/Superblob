Based on the provided images, which depict various outdoor paths in what appears to be a campus or urban park environment, the following landmark features of a trail can be identified:

- A paved sidewalk running alongside a street with parked cars and buildings.
- A winding concrete path through a grassy, tree-lined area, possibly within a park or campus green space.
- A straight concrete walkway bordered by grass and trees, leading toward modern and traditional architecture.

These images highlight that trails can be found in diverse settings — urban streetscapes, open parks, and institutional campuses — and often feature paved surfaces. They are typically flanked by natural elements like trees and grass, as well as man-made structures such as buildings or bike racks. The paths serve both functional (pedestrian access) and aesthetic (scenic views) purposes.
