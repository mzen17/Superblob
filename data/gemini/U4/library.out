Based on the provided images, which depict various urban and commercial environments including a plaza, a street with restaurants, an indoor mall corridor, and a downtown street scene, there are no visible libraries. The user's request to identify "landmark features of library" based on these images is therefore not applicable.

However, if we were to hypothetically describe the landmark features of a library based on common architectural and functional characteristics (as the images do not contain a library), they would typically include:

- A prominent entrance with large glass doors or windows for accessibility and visibility.
- A spacious, well-lit interior with high ceilings, often featuring reading nooks or study areas.
- Bookshelves arranged in long aisles for easy navigation of collections.
- A reference desk staffed by librarians for assistance.
- Quiet zones designed for focused reading and studying.
- Public spaces such as a children's section, a community room, or a digital media lab.
- A prominent sign or logo identifying the building as a library.

Since none of the provided images show a library, it is not possible to identify landmark features specific to them from this set of visuals.
