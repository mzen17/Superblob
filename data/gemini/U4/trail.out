Based on the two images provided, here is a detailed description and an analysis of the landmark features of the trail, focusing on landscape elements as requested.

**Image 1 Analysis:**
This image captures a wide, paved pedestrian bridge or walkway with light green metal railings. The perspective is straight ahead, leading the eye down a path that appears to be elevated. On either side of the walkway are different architectural styles of buildings:
- To the left: A modern building with a facade of grey stone and large glass windows. Behind it is another structure with a distinctive blue-tiled roof section.
- To the right: A mix of older, more traditional brick buildings with arched windows and a green metal roof. One building has an ornate facade.
The sky is bright blue with scattered white clouds, indicating a clear day. The ground beneath the bridge is visible and appears to be grassy or unpaved.

**Image 2 Analysis:**
This image shows a different location, likely at the entrance to a building named "LINDQUIST CENTER," as indicated by the sign above the main doors. The scene is set during twilight or early evening, with artificial lights on. The foreground is dominated by a large area of tall, dry ornamental grasses and other native-looking vegetation, creating a naturalistic buffer between the paved walkway (visible on the right) and the building. A bare tree stands near the entrance. In the background, other buildings are visible under a dusky sky.

**Landmark Features of Trail (based on landscape elements):**

- **Elevated Walkway:** A prominent, straight, paved path with green railings that provides a clear, elevated route through the landscape.
- **Contrasting Architecture:** The trail passes between modern and historic buildings, creating a visual narrative of architectural evolution.
- **Natural Buffer Zones:** The presence of large areas of ornamental grasses and native vegetation along the trail edges softens the urban environment.
- **Transitioning Light:** The images capture different times of day (bright daylight vs. twilight), which can be a landmark feature for photographers or hikers, indicating a change in atmosphere.
- **Urban Green Spaces:** The integration of green spaces (grass, trees) within an urban setting is a key landscape feature.
