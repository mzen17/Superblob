Based on the two images provided, here is a detailed description and an analysis of the landmark features of the bridges, focusing on the specific elements mentioned by the user (lights and bridge rail).

**Image 1 Analysis:**
This image captures a nighttime scene from an elevated stone terrace or balcony. The viewpoint is looking down onto a wide, illuminated avenue or boulevard that stretches into the distance. The road is lined with streetlights casting a warm glow, and the traffic appears as streaks of light due to motion blur. In the background, the silhouettes of city buildings are visible against a hazy night sky. The foreground is dominated by a substantial stone balustrade or railing, which features classical-style balusters and is part of the architectural structure from which the photo was taken. This railing is not part of a bridge but rather an overlook.

**Image 2 Analysis:**
This image captures a modern bridge at dusk or dawn. The sky transitions from deep blue to a soft orange near the horizon. The bridge has a distinctive, graceful arched design with multiple sweeping curves, creating an elegant silhouette. It is illuminated by lights along its length and on its supports. The water below reflects the lights of the bridge and the fading colors of the sky. In the foreground, there is a simple, functional railing made of metal posts and wire mesh, which appears to be part of a viewing platform or walkway adjacent to the water.
