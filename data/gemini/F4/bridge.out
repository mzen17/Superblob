Based on the provided images, which appear to show various views of a campus or urban environment including a river, bridges, and buildings (notably the "College of Law"), I can identify several landmark features associated with the bridge(s) visible.

The images depict at least two different bridges:
- One is a modern, arched pedestrian/bicycle bridge with distinctive curved supports spanning a wide river. It is shown at night (Image 1) and during twilight (Image 3), highlighting its illuminated structure against the sky.
- Another is a more conventional, straighter bridge with green railings, viewed from a pedestrian walkway on a bright, sunny day (Image 2).

Landmark features of these bridges include:

- A prominent modern arched design with sweeping curves that create a distinctive silhouette against the sky.
- Illuminated at night, making it a focal point in the urban landscape.
- Constructed with concrete or steel supports and railings, designed for pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic.
- Located over a wide river or canal, connecting different parts of the campus or city.
- Visible from multiple angles, including from a walkway on one side (Image 2) and from across the water (Image 1).
