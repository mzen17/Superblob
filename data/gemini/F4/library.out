Based on the provided images, here is a detailed description and the requested analysis.

The two images depict different scenes from what appears to be the same urban street at different times of night.

- **Image 1:** This image captures a street scene during twilight or early evening. The sky is a deep blue, indicating dusk. On the left is a brick building with large windows; signage reads "Barnacino Restaurant Pizza" and "TIP TOGUE BEE". Several cars are parked along the curb, and bicycles are chained to a post. A tall, modern apartment or office building with illuminated windows stands in the background. The streetlights are on, casting a warm glow on the pavement.

- **Image 2:** This image shows the same street at a later time, now fully dark. The most prominent feature is large, leafless trees decorated with strings of warm white fairy lights that trace their branches. A traffic light is visible in the distance, showing red. The storefronts are more visible under the night sky; one on the right has a bright blue facade. Pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalk.

The user has related these details to "tree". While trees are a significant element in both images (especially in image 2 with their festive lights), they are not landmarks of a library. The question asks for landmark features of a library, which is not depicted in either image. Libraries typically have features such as large windows for reading areas, bookshelves, quiet study spaces, and often a prominent entrance or atrium.

Therefore, based on the images provided (which show trees and storefronts but no library), it is not possible to identify landmark features of a library from this visual information.
